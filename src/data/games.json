Created by multiple builders in the Nine Circles style, this level was considered humanly impossible for years due to its extremely tight wave sections, requiring inputs faster than 15 clicks per second through micro-gaps. The level's verification journey was fraught with accusations, skepticism, and heated debates within the community. With its distinctive silent theme and minimal audio cues, players must rely purely on visual timing through some of the most demanding wave gameplay ever created.
